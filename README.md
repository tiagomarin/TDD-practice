# TDD-project
This project is part of my Microverse journey and its purpose is to test my abilities to use test-driven development aproach (TDD). The idea is to write tests first and then the code.

# Features

A Solver class with:
- factorial method.
- reverse method.
- fizzbuzz method.

## Built With
